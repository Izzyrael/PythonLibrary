In this lesson we will be working out of main.py however we have 2 other
files that also are a commented out on why we need them

these other 2 files have the classes we will be using in our main.py file that
we don't want cluttering up our main.py so that's why we split them up

BE SURE TO MARK '02_MODULES' AS SOURCE DIRECTORY FOR THIS LESSON
we do this by right-clicking '02_modules' > Mark Directory As > Sources Root
otherwise the lesson will have a lot of errors
