# lambda functions are anonymous functions that allow us to write short and simple functions
# they can take arguments and get called the same way as a normal function
# so what if we want a function that doubles a number, lets do that now


def double(x):
    return x * 2


# easy right? lets make it even simpler


double_lambda = lambda x: x * 2  # notice no paranthesis and the new 'lambda' keyword
